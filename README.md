# ArtGallery-myFirstWebsite

This is my first and own created website. I created this art gallery website for 
'web technologies' module's individual final project in my university.
I used my lecture works and Internet resources like you tube, google as references
to create this website. During this project work, I learned lots of html,
css, javascript and php techniques and how they are helping in a website creation.
